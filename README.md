# Bank Note Authentication using SSIM (Python)

## Overview

This Python project aims to authenticate Indian currency notes of denominations 500 and 2000 using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The SSIM is a metric that measures the structural similarity between two images, making it suitable for comparing and authenticating images of banknotes.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- scikit-image

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-image
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-note-authentication.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bank-note-authentication
   ```

3. Run the authentication script:

   ```bash
   python authenticate_banknote.py
   ```

   Replace `authenticate_banknote.py` with the actual name of your authentication script.

## Configuration

Adjust the script parameters and configurations as needed, such as image paths, SSIM threshold, etc., in the script itself or through a configuration file.

## Example

The script will compare the input banknote images with reference images and print whether the banknote is authentic based on the SSIM metric.

```bash
Authenticating 500 INR Note...
SSIM: 0.95 (Authentic)

Authenticating 2000 INR Note...
SSIM: 0.92 (Authentic)
```
